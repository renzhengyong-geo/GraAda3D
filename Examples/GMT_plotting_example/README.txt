1 GMT_slice_node_reg.sh: Slice 3D netcdf data, write out with node registration

2 GMT_slice_node_reg.sh: Slice 3D netcdf data, write out with pixel registration

For explation of two ways of data organization, see https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.1/cookbook/options.html#option-nodereg

There is not much difference between the two ways of regisration, but the pixel registration may better depict the inversion mesh. And
the node registration may cause slight distortion.
